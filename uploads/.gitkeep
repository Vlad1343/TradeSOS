# This file ensures the uploads directory is tracked by git
# The uploads directory is used for storing user-uploaded files like:
# - Insurance documents for trade professionals
# - Job photos from customers
# - Profile pictures (future feature)

# Files in this directory are served by the Flask application
# through the /uploads/<filename> route

# In production, consider using cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, etc.)
# instead of local file storage for better scalability and reliability
